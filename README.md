PROJECT WITH REACT + EXTERNAL API (GOOGLE MAPS).

In this case, I have used the React library to create the project, consuming the Google Maps API.

The web browser displays the coordinates of the city of Madrid, and three functional markers, which zoom in on the area when clicked.

I have used Trello as a tool to organize the backlog and Figma for the web prototyping.

About the code, I have used JavaScript, CSS, and the React library. I employed a little bit of Bootstrap too, even though it has been only for the header, as an exercise to get used myself with it.

Although I still have a limited understanding of JavaScript code and implementing it with React, with the ChatGPT help and some video tutorials, I managed to get the application to work and made some modifications to customize it.

I have also deployed my project on the Vercel platform. The URL to my website is:
https://google-maps-react-9vvzwywjo-maseiz.vercel.app/

I am currently learning to conduct some testing for my project. I hope to have it ready soon.

Finally, I uploaded a repository of my proyect to GitHub.
