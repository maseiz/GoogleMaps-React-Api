PROJECT WITH REACT + EXTERNAL API (GOOGLE MAPS).

In this case, I have used the React library to create the project, consuming the Google Maps API.
The web browser displays the coordinates of the city of Madrid, and three functional markers, which zoom in on the area when clicked.
I have used Trello as a tool to organize the backlog and Figma for the web prototyping.
About the code, I have used JavaScript, CSS, and the React library. I also used Bootstrap, even though it has been only for the header, as an exercise to familiarize myself with it.
